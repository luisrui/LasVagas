## Basic Rules
Set costomized number of players, number of boards and number of dices and total price, you can start a game on your own. 

Las Vegas is an easy-to-learn, dice-rolling game that includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat in the basic game, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable. 

Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked "1". You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the highest-valued money associated with it, then the player with the secondmost dice takes the next highest-valued money card. In case of a tie, the non-tied player with the most dice takes the highest-valued money card at that casino, while the tied players get bupkis.

Las Vegas Royale includes twelve expansion tiles, and to play a more involved game, you can place an expansion tile at random by each casino. These tiles have special abilities on them, and by placing dice on them, players can activate these abilities. The expansion components also include a larger than normal die for each player that counts as two dice.

The more crazy rules is under developing!!!!

#### ZH-translation version 中文介绍说明
Las Vegas 是一款简单易学的掷骰子游戏，其中包含六个纸板赌场垫，一个用于普通六面骰子的每一面。 对于基本游戏中的每个垫子，玩家都会抽钱卡，直到显示至少 50,000 美元，但最终金额可能会更多，从而使赌场金额更加诱人。

每个玩家有八个不同颜色的骰子，他们轮流掷骰子。 当您掷骰子时，您可以选择将它们放在相关的赌场牌上； 例如，显示 1 的骰子将被放置在标有“1”的赌场垫上。 您必须轮流将一个数字的所有骰子都放在一个赌场。 所有玩家轮流这样做，直到所有的骰子都被用完。 最后，在每张赌场卡上拥有最多骰子的玩家拿走与其关联的最高价值的钱，然后拥有第二多骰子的玩家拿走下一张价值最高的金钱卡。 如果出现平局，则拥有最多骰子的未并列玩家将获得该赌场价值最高的金钱卡，而并列玩家将获得 bupkis。

Las Vegas Royale 包括 12 个扩展板块，要玩更复杂的游戏，您可以在每个赌场随机放置一个扩展板块。 这些方块上有特殊的能力，通过在上面放置骰子，玩家可以激活这些能力。 扩展组件还包括一个比普通玩家更大的骰子，算作两个骰子。
